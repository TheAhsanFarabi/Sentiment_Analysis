# Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

This project implements a simple sentiment analysis model using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on a dataset, and users can input sentences to get predictions about the sentiment of the input.

## Description

The sentiment analysis model uses a Logistic Regression algorithm to predict whether a given input sentence has a positive or negative sentiment. The project includes data preprocessing steps, such as removing handles, URLs, stop words, and converting text to lowercase.
